EXT. NEW YORK CITY.

We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL.

At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,
head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up
to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle
shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.

		DADE
	Excuse me.

		KID
	Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.

		DADE
	Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the
	principal's office.

		KID
	Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the
office.

INT. OFFICE.

Dade is filling out a form.

		GIRL
	Do you have your transfer forms?

Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly
unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.

		GIRL
	It's a relatively straightforward question.

Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches
into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,
all involving lips and kissing.

		GIRL
	Do you speak English?

		DADE
	Sorry, you wanted...?

		GIRL
	I wanted transfer forms.

He gives them to her.

		GIRL
	Thank you.

She starts leaving. He doesn't.

		GIRL
	Are you coming?

Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on
a brief tour.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

		GIRL
	The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is
	through there.

		DADE
	Great. Cool.
		(pause)
	What's your name?

		GIRL
	Kate. Kate Libby.

They arrive at a classroom.

		KATE
	Here's your class.

		DADE
	My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?

		KATE
	No, you're not in my class.

Kate starts away.

		DADE
	Give me time!

A guy in the halls notices Dade.

		GUY
	Hey, you new?

		DADE
	Yeah.

		GUY
	Tell him about the pool, Kate.

		DADE
	Pool?

		KATE
	Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up
	on the roof. Take the stairs over there.

		DADE
	Yeah! Sure.

Kate starts away again.

		DADE
	Thanks!

EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.

Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
One of them notices Dade.

		GEEK
	Hey! Hold the door!

He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.

		Dade
		(realizing he's been had)
	No pool.

Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
raining.
